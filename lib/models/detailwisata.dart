Pada abad ke-19, Mads Lange, seorang pedagang Denmark, datang ke Bali dan mendirikan basis perdagangan di Kuta. Ia ahli bernegosiasi sehingga dirinya terkenal di antara raja-raja Bali dan Belanda.[1] Selanjutnya, Hugh Mahbett menerbitkan sebuah buku berjudul “Praise to Kuta” yang berisi ajakan kepada masyarakat setempat untuk menyiapkan fasilitas akomodasi wisata. Tujuannya untuk mengantisipasi ledakan wisatawan yang berkunjung ke Bali. Buku itu kemudian menginspirasi banyak orang untuk membangun fasilitas wisata seperti penginapan, restoran dan tempat hiburan.[1]"),
